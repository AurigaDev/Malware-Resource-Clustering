# System Log Collection

Project to explore collection of system calls in host based system.

Current iteration uses auditd to collect all events and filters out system calls for enumeration of traces for each process.

#Current Limitations:
Processes have no name attached to process ID
System is limited performance while log collection is undergoing, or log buffer in auditd results in very small log collection.
